### My name is Ante, I'm software engineer from Split, Croatia

As a software engineer with over 17 years of experience, I have a strong foundation in computer science and a proven track record of delivering successful software projects. Over the past 7 years, I have focused on JavaScript development, building a range of applications and microservices.

I have excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently or as part of a team. I am comfortable working in agile development environments and am always looking for ways to improve processes and increase efficiency.

I am passionate about staying up to date with the latest technologies and best practices, and I am always seeking out opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I am excited about the prospect of joining a dynamic team where I can contribute my skills and experience to create innovative software solutions.

Currently exploring Python.
